# Sparse model Step-by-Step
Here is a example from pruning a distilbert base model using group lasso during a distillation process to get sparse model, and then 
inference with Transformers-accelerated Library which is a high-performance operator computing library. Overall, get performance improvement.
# Prerequisite

## Installation

1.1 Install python environment
Create a new python environment

```shell
conda create -n <env name> python=3.8
conda activate <env name>
```

Check the gcc version using $gcc-v, make sure the gcc version is higher than 7.0.
If not, you need to update gcc by yourself.
Make sure the cmake version is 3 rather than 2.
Make sure you have the autoconf installed.
If not, you need to install autoconf by yourself.
If not, you need to install cmake.

```shell
cmake --version
conda install cmake
sudo apt install autoconf
```

Install Intel Extension for Transformers from Source Code

```shell
cd <intel_extension_for_transformers_folder>
git submodule update --init --recursive
python setup.py install
```
Install package for examples
```shell
cd <intel_extension_for_transformers_folder>/examples/deployment/neural_engine/sparse/distilbert_base_uncased
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
>**Note**: Recommend install protobuf <= 3.20.0 if use onnxruntime <= 1.11


## Environment Variables 
Preload libjemalloc.so can improve the performance when multi instance.
```
export LD_PRELOAD=<intel_extension_for_transformers_folder>/intel_extension_for_transformers/backends/neural_engine/executor/third_party/jemalloc/lib/libjemalloc.so
```
Using weight sharing can save memory and improve the performance when multi instance.
```
export WEIGHT_SHARING=1
export INST_NUM=<inst num>
```
# Inference Pipeline
Neural Engine can parse ONNX model and Neural Engine IR. 
We provide with three mode: accuracy, throughput or latency. For throughput mode, we will use multi-instance with 4cores/instance occupying one socket.
You can run fp32 model inference by setting `precision=fp32`, command as follows:

```shell
bash run_bert_large.sh --model=Intel/distilbert-base-uncased-squadv1.1-sparse-80-1X4-block --dataset=squad --precision=fp32
```

By setting `precision=int8` you could get PTQ int8 model and setting `precision=bf16` to get bf16 model.
```shell
bash run_bert_large.sh --model=Intel/distilbert-base-uncased-squadv1.1-sparse-80-1X4-block --dataset=squad --precision=int8
```

Then you can generate transposed sparse model to get better performance, command as follows:
```shell
python export_transpose_ir.py --input_model=./model_and_tokenizer/int8-model.onnx
```

### Benchmark
Neural Engine will automatically detect weight structured sparse ratio, as long as it beyond 70% (since normaly get performance gain when sparse ratio beyond 70%), Neural Engine will call [Transformers-accelerated Libraries](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers/tree/develop/intel_extension_for_transformers/backends/neural_engine/kernels) and high performance layernorm op with transpose mode to improve inference performance.

## Accuracy
  run python
  ```shell
  GLOG_minloglevel=2 python run_executor.py --input_model=./sparse_int8_ir  --tokenizer_dir=./model_and_tokenizer --mode=accuracy --data_dir=./data --batch_size=8
  ```

## Performance
  run python
  
  ```shell
  GLOG_minloglevel=2 python run_executor.py --input_model=./sparse_int8_ir --mode=performance --batch_size=8 --seq_len=128
  ```
  
  or run C++
  The warmup below is recommended to be 1/10 of iterations and no less than 3.
  
  ```
  export GLOG_minloglevel=2
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<cpu_cores>
  export DNNL_MAX_CPU_ISA=AVX512_CORE_AMX
  export UNIFIED_BUFFER=1
  numactl -C 0-<cpu_cores-1> <intel_extension_for_transformers_folder>/intel_extension_for_transformers/backends/neural_engine/bin/neural_engine
  --batch_size=<batch_size> --iterations=<iterations> --w=<warmup>
  --seq_len=128 --config=./sparse_int8_ir/conf.yaml --weight=./sparse_int8_ir/model.bin
  ```
